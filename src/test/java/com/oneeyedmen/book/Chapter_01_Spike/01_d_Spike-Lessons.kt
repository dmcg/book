Conclusions
-----------

What has this chapter been trying to prove?

Firstly I've been trying to prove to myself that this model works for me when actually explaining concepts. Unless you're viewing the source version of this text, you won't see that there is a subtlety around the different versions of the code existing in the same source file. When explaining code on my blog I would have to move forward and back between different source versions, cutting and pasting them into the code. Here, I can keep the different versions in the same file, which is a big productivity win.

Secondly, I'm trying to demonstrate risk reduction - making sure that I don't commit too much effort into a doomed venture. We've done just enough here to show that the book-in-comments approach has legs. No doubt I'll spend days on tooling to produce the book before I'm finished - the code is rough and the inability to write about my own notation without invoking it is a shame - but right now we have confidence without too much cost.

Tooling is another take-away. Modern developers will go to great lengths to increase their own productivity by building tools to leverage their time. Sometimes these are simple scripts, sometimes full applications. I'm hoping to leverage the power of an IDE that I already know with some text processing to produce something greater than the sum of its parts.

Leverage is my final thought. Great developers find ways of solving several problems at once. I don't claim to be a great developer, but I am secretly pleased with having tested the writing model, written some tooling to support it, and perhaps demonstrated some aspects of modern programming, all at the same time.

## Request for Feedback

Well you've either got this far, or skipped here having decided that the content wasn't from you. Could you spare a couple of minutes to help me gauge whether I am wasting my time?

If so then create an [email to me](mailto:duncan@oneeyedmen.com?subject=Book+Feedback), copy the following into an email, start answering at the top, keep going until you don't think you owe me any more or your precious time, and send. I'm sorry that I don't have an embedded form or anything - yet. Maybe if there is enough encouragement the processing of the form will become a chapter!

>  3. What do you think of the recursive nature of the material, writing about the development of the software to assist the writing? [0 (disaster) - 10 (triumph)]
>  4. How likely are you to recommend the book to a friend or colleague? [0 (not at all) - 10 (extremely)]

Thank you

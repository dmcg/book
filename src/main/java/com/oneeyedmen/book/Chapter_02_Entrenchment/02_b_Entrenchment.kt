/*-
Returning to this project after a little time, I review the code and the prose, and find that I can just about follow my original thread. I'm still far from convinced that anyone else could make sense of it though. The best way to find out would be to share the first chapter with friends to get their feedback, but the published Markdown files aren't yet actually readable. In particular

1. I have no way of escaping my own formatting markers, so I can't represent them in the output text.

2. The contents of the approved files are not shown (as I write this they are represented by `[TODO]` markers).

Markdown doesn't have any standard way of representing included text, but as we're reading and writing every line it shouldn't be too hard to do this ourselves. That leaves the escaping as a bigger risk, as I don't have a clue what to do.

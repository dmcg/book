# Introduction

The aim of this book is to teach software development by example. Rather than canned examples with predetermined teaching goals and known solutions, it documents programming episodes, with real-world uncertainties, blind-alleys, short-cuts and failures. It is, in short, a book about engineering.

I have lots of programming books on my bookshelves, both physical and virtual, and they have taught me a lot. But in their thousands of pages there is very little that compares to pairing with another programmer and seeing how they work. Many books show you the end result - what your code should look like. A few show you how you might get there.

This is not a book to teach you how to program. It assumes that you have already mastered the basics, consider yourself an accomplished developer, but want to improve. Frankly I’m in the same boat. My aim is to write the book that I wished I’d read 5 years ago, one that discusses software development in the way that we might if we bumped into each other at a conference, or paired with each other on some code for a client.

I’ve been lucky enough to work with some excellent developers over the years, largely in a community that coalesced around eXtreme Programming in London around 2000. We explored the effects of pair programming, Test Driven Development and refactoring together, and reported our progress at conferences and workshops. In the early days our code would have been characterised as Object Oriented, but these days there is a trend towards a mixed OO / functional style.

built up around and whilst it has struck me how much we agree I try to be prescriptive only when

It's always difficult to know what to write about. Two quotes haunt me. The first I remember reading from the Unix fortunes.dat file

```
"It is never worth a first-class man's time to express a majority opinion. By definition, there are plenty of others to do that."
```

which Wikipedia attributes to G H Hardy, and

```
"I feel that if a person can't communicate, the very least he can do is to shut up."
```

which was Tom Lehrer.

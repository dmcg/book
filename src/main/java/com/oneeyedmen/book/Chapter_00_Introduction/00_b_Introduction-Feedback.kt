## Request for Feedback

If you've got this far through the introduction, I hope that I have at least piqued your interest. Even if I haven't though, can I ask you to give me some feedback?

If this section is still in the book it is still some way from being completed. Honestly, I don't know how it is working out. I'm really enjoying writing it, some people have said that they enjoyed reading it, but whether it is adding value to the world, and whether the format and topic stand a chance of meeting their aims, are still up for grabs.

If the book does interest you, and you reach the end of Chapter One and still have any will to live left, please follow the instructions there to send me feedback.

If you've decided on the text so far that the book isn't for you, but can spare me 2 more minutes of your time, then please follow the instructions below.

Thank you

Duncan

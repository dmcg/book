## Request for Feedback

If you've got this far through the introduction, I hope that I have at least piqued your interest. Even if I haven't though, can I ask you to give me some feedback?

If this section is still in the book it is still some way from being completed. Honestly, I don't know how it is working out. I'm really enjoying writing it, some people have said that they enjoyed reading it, but whether it is adding value to the world, and whether the format and topic stand a chance of meeting their aims, are still up for grabs.

If you've decided on the text so far that the book isn't for you, but can spare me 2 more minutes of your time, skip to the end of Chapter One, fill out the questionnaire there, and email the results to me.

If the book does interest you, if you reach the end of Chapter One and still have any will to live left, do the same.

Thank you

Duncan
